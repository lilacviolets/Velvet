## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is this safe to use?

Yes, but as with any system modification tool, there's always some risk.  
That's why we create a restore point first.

### Will this break my computer?

No. The script only removes non-essential apps and adjusts privacy settings.  
Critical system components are not touched.

### Can I use this on a school/work computer?

Check with your IT department first.  
Some organizations have policies against running custom scripts.

### How much space will this free up?

Typically **500MB ‚Äì 2GB**, depending on your system and temp files.

### Can I customize what gets removed?

Yes! The script is open source.  
Edit the `$bloatware` array to add or remove apps.

### Will Windows Update still work?

Yes, Windows Update functions normally after running this script.

## üîß Customization

To customize which apps are removed, edit the `$bloatware` array around **line 47**:

```powershell
$bloatware = @(
    "Microsoft.BingNews",
    "Microsoft.BingWeather",
    # Add more apps here
)
```

To find the package name of an app, run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage | Select Name
```
